\subsection{Testing}
To test the interpreter I wrote a small regression testing framework called \verb!bungee!\footnote{\url{http://github.com/henrythacker/bungee}}. After every change the script was fired off to ensure that all tests continue to yield the correct results. Unfortunately it will not run on the BUCS machines because certain Ruby dependencies are unavailable.
